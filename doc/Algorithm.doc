Gravitational Wave Simulation Algorithms:

Body Algorithm

    for each [body] in [universe]
    begin
        extract the list of waves containing the [body] that is not induced by [body] itself.
        eliminate all waves from the same [source] except for the youngest ones.
        calculate acceleration vector to [body] using remaining wave list.
        set [body] acceleration vector.
        update [body] velocity vector.
        update [body] positions.
    end

Wave Algorithm

    for each [wave] in [universe]
    begin
        if [wave] [age] exceeds [wave_life]
        begin
            discard wave.
        else
            update [wave] [radius] according to constant [speed] value.
            update [wave] [age] value.
        end
    end

Universe Algorithm

    while not done
    begin
        update [bodies] in [universe] for current [time_frame].
        update [waves] in [universe] for current [time_frame].

        for each [body] in [universe]
        begin
            initiate a new [wave] of [age] zero from current [body] [position].
        end

        increment [time_frame].
    end
